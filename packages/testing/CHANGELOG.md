# @dawn-ai/testing

## 0.8.0

### Patch Changes

- README refresh for GTM: SEO keyword pass, a Star/Docs/Discussions CTA band on the root and developer-facing package READMEs, doc links repointed to the live dawnai.org site, and READMEs added for previously-blank packages (`workspace`, `permissions`, `sqlite-storage`, `testing`, `evals`).
- Version realignment: all public Dawn packages now share a single version (`0.8.0`) and release together going forward. This package is renumbered down from its previous independent 5.x line; the old higher versions were removed from npm.

## 5.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 2be46a4: Add `expectToolSequence(run, names, opts?)` and `expectNoToolErrors(run)` matchers,
  plus a derived `toolResults` field on `AgentRunResult` (and a `deriveToolResults`
  helper). `expectToolSequence` asserts tool call order (subsequence by default,
  `{ strict: true }` for contiguous); `expectNoToolErrors` catches tools that
  returned an error result while correctly treating HITL permission interrupts as
  non-errors.

### Minor Changes

- b51de58: Add `@dawn-ai/testing` — a productized, aimock-backed package for writing deterministic, CI-safe tests of Dawn agents.

  The model is mocked at the HTTP wire via `@copilotkit/aimock`, so tests exercise the real agent loop, tool calls, streaming, state, offloading, and summarization without a live API key. Three layers, one package:

  - **In-process (default):** `createAgentHarness({ appRoot, route })` runs your route through Dawn's runtime; the fastest layer and the one most users reach for.
  - **http-inject:** `injectAgentProtocol({ appRoot })` drives the full Agent-Protocol request→response pipeline in-process via `light-my-request` (no port bound) — for framework/SSE coverage.
  - **subprocess:** `startSubprocessApp({ appRoot })` boots a real `dawn dev` — for restart/persistence scenarios.

  A fluent `script()` builder compiles multi-turn tool-call conversations to aimock fixtures (auto `turnIndex`/`hasToolResult`, fixed `tool_call_id`s), and `expect*` matchers assert agent behavior: `expectToolCalled().withArgs()`, `expectFinalMessage()`, `expectStreamedTokens()`, `expectState().field()`, `expectOffloaded()`. A local-only `record()` helper captures real interactions into fixtures (CI replays strict/read-only).

  `@dawn-ai/cli` gains a `@dawn-ai/cli/runtime` programmatic export subpath (`streamResolvedRoute`, `createRuntimeRegistry`, `runTypegen`, `createRuntimeRequestListener`, …) and `buildOffload` now resolves the workspace relative to the app root (no behavior change under `dawn dev`, where cwd is the app root).

  `@dawn-ai/langchain` fixes a bug where the streamed `tool_call` event carried `undefined` tool arguments — `on_tool_start` now reads `event.data.input` (the field LangChain populates with tool args), so stream consumers (e.g. UI tool-call displays) receive the real arguments.

  Dawn's own aimock e2e lane (SP5 union schema, SP6a tool-output offloading, conversation summarization) was migrated onto this package in-process, removing the per-test `pnpm pack` + install + dev-server boot.

- d4efa2a: `@dawn-ai/core`: the workspace and AGENTS.md capabilities now activate relative to the **app root** instead of `process.cwd()`, so they work when an app is run from any working directory (e.g. in-process tests, embedded use). No behavior change under `dawn dev` (where cwd is the app root). `CapabilityMarkerContext` gained a required `appRoot: string` field — if you construct that type in a custom capability marker or its tests, add `appRoot`.

  Extend `@dawn-ai/testing` to cover the rest of Dawn's agent capabilities. `AgentRunResult` now captures interrupts, plan updates, subagent runs, and the composed system prompt (read from aimock's request journal via `AimockHandle.getRequests()`); `harness.resume({ decision })` drives HITL interrupt→resume flows. New matchers: `expectInterrupt`/`expectNoInterrupt`, `expectSubagent`, `expectPlan`, `expectSystemPrompt` (and `expectPlan().toHaveLength`, `expectSystemPrompt().toMatch`). Dawn's own chat/coordinator example apps are now dogfooded with in-process e2e for HITL permissions, subagents, planning, skills, and AGENTS.md memory. The dogfood surfaced and fixed a harness bug: gpt-5/reasoning routes send the system prompt under the `developer` role, which the system-prompt capture now recognizes. No framework changes — all capability events were already emitted by the runtime. CI now runs the `@dawn-ai/testing` package suite and the chat-example capability e2e (both were previously absent from the vitest workspace).

- 64ca1c7: `@dawn-ai/testing`: close the fixture record→commit→replay loop with `loadFixtures(path)` / `writeFixtures(path, script()|FixtureSet)`, and add a gated live mode — `createAgentHarness({ live: true })` runs the real model via aimock proxy-record (real responses, with `run.systemPrompt` retained), requiring `OPENAI_API_KEY` and meant to be gated with `skipIf` (never in CI). Drift detection remains deferred to a future phase. (A `create-dawn-ai-app` scaffold sample test will follow once `@dawn-ai/testing` is published to npm.)
