## 0.8.18

### Patch Changes

- c6b08a9: Add keyed, parent-owned subagent delegation policies with fail-closed
  constraints and approval. Subagents now run as native resumable LangGraph
  subgraphs, and interrupt resume uses one complete multi-entry request envelope.

  This intentionally removes array-form subagent registration, tool policy on
  the internal `task` mechanism, and scalar interrupt resume. Confirm the fixed
  0.x patch release intent with Brian before release.

## 0.8.17

### Patch Changes

- 713797f: Purge `node:` imports from the edge module graph (deploy-anywhere B3, PR 2a).

  A bundle built from `@dawn-ai/cli/fetch` now links **zero** `node:` specifiers —
  previously it linked 33 of them (including `node:fs` and `node:child_process`)
  via Dawn's own supporting packages. Because static imports resolve when a module
  graph is instantiated, those edges made the bundle require a `node:` shim layer
  (Cloudflare Workers with `nodejs_compat`) even though the injected request path
  never called them. The artifact is now runtime-agnostic, verified by an esbuild
  purity test that bundles on the `neutral` and `browser` platforms with no `node:`
  externals and asserts an empty graph, plus a negative control proving the check
  still fails against the CLI entry.

  **Node-only exports moved to `/node` subpaths.** They are unchanged in behavior;
  only the import specifier differs:

  - `@dawn-ai/core` → `@dawn-ai/core/node`: `discoverRoutes`, `findDawnApp`,
    `assertDawnRoutesDir`, `extractToolSchemasForRoute`, `extractToolTypesForRoute`,
    `registerTsxLoader`
  - `@dawn-ai/permissions` → `@dawn-ai/permissions/node`: `createPermissionsStore`
  - `@dawn-ai/workspace` → `@dawn-ai/workspace/node`: `localFilesystem`, `localExec`

  **New:** `@dawn-ai/sdk/pure` (pure path/hash helpers, parity-tested against
  `node:path`/`node:crypto`); `@dawn-ai/core` gains `registerConfigLoader` and the
  `DawnConfigLoader` type; `@dawn-ai/core/node` gains `registerNodeConfigLoader`,
  `loadDawnConfigUncached`, and `nodeLoadRouteDescription`. `CapabilityMarkerContext`
  gains optional `backendFactories` and `loadRouteDescription` — capability markers
  no longer reach for node implementations by static import, and throw a named error
  when a runtime supplies neither an instance nor a factory.

  **Behavior change:** `createWorkspaceFs` now requires an absolute, POSIX-normalized
  `workspaceRoot` and throws a named error otherwise. Previously a relative root
  silently resolved against `process.cwd()`. Every in-repo caller already passes an
  absolute path; the host lane canonicalizes before calling core. This is
  fail-closed — it cannot widen the workspace path jail, only reject earlier and
  more loudly.

## 0.8.16

### Patch Changes

- 2da55fa: Require Node 24 (the active LTS) everywhere. npm 10 — bundled with Node 22 —
  cannot install Dawn's scaffold dependency graph (its resolver crashes), while
  Node 24's bundled npm ≥ 11 installs it correctly and ships `node:sqlite`
  unflagged. All packages now declare `engines.node >= 24`, `create-dawn-ai-app`
  refuses to scaffold on older Node with an actionable message, `dawn verify`'s
  runtime preflight enforces the same floor, and the `dawn build` node target
  uses a `node:24-slim` base. Scaffolded apps also no longer declare
  `@dawn-ai/core` as a direct dependency — nothing in a generated app imports it
  (it arrives transitively via the CLI and SDK).

### Patch Changes

- dd02f56: New memory write-governance mode `writes: "ask"`: memory supersedes (belief contradictions) prompt a HITL Once/Always/Deny interrupt with old-vs-new detail; ADDs and idempotent updates flow silently; headless behaves as `auto`. New `kind: "memory"` permission interrupt, `gateMemorySupersede`, `suggestedMemoryPattern`, and a `dawn check` warning for the `ask` + `approve: ["remember"]` double-gate overlap.

## 0.8.7

## 0.8.6

### Patch Changes

- 1d51b75: Per-tool approval gating: `agent({ tools: { approve: ["deployProd"] } })` makes any named tool require a HITL permission prompt per call (`kind: "tool"` interrupt). Decisions persist name-level under the reserved `tool` key in `.dawn/permissions.json` (exact-name matching); pre-approve via `permissions.allow.tool`. `dawn check` validates `approve` names and warns on overlap with the internally-gated workspace tools, `deny`, and the unsupported `task` case.

### Patch Changes

- README refresh for GTM: SEO keyword pass, a Star/Docs/Discussions CTA band on the root and developer-facing package READMEs, doc links repointed to the live dawnai.org site, and READMEs added for previously-blank packages (`workspace`, `permissions`, `sqlite-storage`, `testing`, `evals`).
- Version realignment: all public Dawn packages now share a single version (`0.8.0`) and release together going forward.
