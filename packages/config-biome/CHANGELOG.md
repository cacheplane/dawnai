# @dawn-ai/config-biome

## 0.8.23

### Patch Changes

- 7e62bb1: Refresh the GitHub and npm documentation surfaces, add package discovery
  metadata, and introduce reproducible product-loop media. No runtime API changed.

## 0.8.22

### Patch Changes

- bedad77: Documentation only: every public export of this package now has an API reference
  page on dawnai.org, and the package README leads with a concise entrypoint. No
  runtime behavior changed.
- 9385d28: Skip generated `.dawn/` output when linting.

  `dawn build` and `dawn dev` write `.dawn/`, which is gitignored and regenerated
  on every run, so linting it reports diagnostics nobody can act on. The shared
  config already set `vcs.useIgnoreFile`, but with `vcs.enabled` false it never
  took effect — and enabling it is not an option here, because Biome resolves the
  ignore file relative to each invocation's working directory and a workspace
  package that has no `.gitignore` of its own then fails outright. Excluding the
  directory in `files.includes` works from any directory.

### Patch Changes

- 2da55fa: Require Node 24 (the active LTS) everywhere. npm 10 — bundled with Node 22 —
  cannot install Dawn's scaffold dependency graph (its resolver crashes), while
  Node 24's bundled npm ≥ 11 installs it correctly and ships `node:sqlite`
  unflagged. All packages now declare `engines.node >= 24`, `create-dawn-ai-app`
  refuses to scaffold on older Node with an actionable message, `dawn verify`'s
  runtime preflight enforces the same floor, and the `dawn build` node target
  uses a `node:24-slim` base. Scaffolded apps also no longer declare
  `@dawn-ai/core` as a direct dependency — nothing in a generated app imports it
  (it arrives transitively via the CLI and SDK).

### Patch Changes

- README refresh for GTM: SEO keyword pass, a Star/Docs/Discussions CTA band on the root and developer-facing package READMEs, doc links repointed to the live dawnai.org site, and READMEs added for previously-blank packages (`workspace`, `permissions`, `sqlite-storage`, `testing`, `evals`).
- Version realignment: all public Dawn packages now share a single version (`0.8.0`) and release together going forward.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 0f32260: Normalize the public Dawn packages for publishing, including release metadata,
  packed artifact validation, and packaged template assets for `@dawn-ai/devkit`.

  Make `create-dawn-app` standalone by default so external scaffolds use release
  channel package specifiers, while keeping explicit internal monorepo scaffolding
  behind a guarded `--mode internal` path.
