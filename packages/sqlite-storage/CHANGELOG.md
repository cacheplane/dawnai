# @dawn-ai/sqlite-storage

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- cfc3e8c: Add Agent Protocol HTTP endpoints backed by a Dawn-native SQLite checkpointer (phase-3 sub-project 7).

  - New `@dawn-ai/sqlite-storage` package: `sqliteCheckpointer` (a `BaseCheckpointSaver` over Node's built-in `node:sqlite`, no native deps) and `createThreadsStore`. Requires Node 22.13+ (where `node:sqlite` is available without the `--experimental-sqlite` flag).
  - `dawn.config.ts` gains `checkpointer` and `threadsStore` fields — both pluggable, with SQLite-backed defaults at `.dawn/checkpoints.sqlite` and `.dawn/threads.sqlite`.
  - The dev server's HTTP layer is reshaped to the Agent Protocol: `POST /threads`, `GET`/`DELETE /threads/{id}`, `POST /threads/{id}/runs/stream`, `POST /threads/{id}/runs/wait`, `GET /threads/{id}/state`, `POST /threads/{id}/resume`. The legacy `POST /runs/stream` is removed.
  - Conversation state and permission interrupts now survive a server restart. `MemorySaver` is removed from `@dawn-ai/langchain`; the checkpointer is supplied by the caller. Permission resume is state-based (reads the parked interrupt from the checkpoint) and resolves the route durably from thread metadata.
