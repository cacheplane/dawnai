### Patch Changes

- ca9bc13: Add `@dawn-ai/memory-pgvector` — a Postgres + pgvector MemoryStore backend for
  production/multi-instance vector memory. Enable with
  `memory: { store: pgvectorMemoryStore({ connectionString, dimensions }) }`. HNSW
  (cosine) vector retrieval; reuses the exact same pure hybrid ranking (RRF +
  recency/confidence) as the default sqlite backend, so recall ordering is
  identical across backends. Adds a shared `runMemoryStoreConformance` kit
  (@dawn-ai/testing) run against both backends. Dimensions ≤2000 use `vector`,
  ≤4000 use `halfvec` (text-embedding-3-large); pgvectorscale/DiskANN and in-SQL
  RRF are deferred. Also pins `openaiEmbedder` to float embedding encoding
  (`encodingFormat: "float"`) — avoids a base64 decode interop quirk that could
  yield wrong embedding dimensionality against some proxies/mocks.
- 1dd2147: Opt-in vector/semantic recall for long-term memory. Enable with
  `memory: { vector: { embedder: openaiEmbedder() } }`: recall becomes hybrid —
  keyword (IDF) and vector (cosine) candidate lists fused co-equally by Reciprocal
  Rank Fusion, with a bounded recency/confidence second stage. Keyword recall is
  never dropped (dense retrieval is weak on exact IDs/codes/names), and default
  keyword-only recall is unchanged. Pluggable `Embedder` (`openaiEmbedder`,
  `fakeEmbedder`); embeddings stored as Float32 BLOBs in the existing node:sqlite
  store (zero new native deps), tagged by embedder id with graceful keyword-only
  fallback on model change. pgvector is a planned follow-up backend.

## 0.8.8

### Patch Changes

- 26780ab: `serializeNamespace` now percent-encodes the reserved delimiters (`%`, `|`, `=`) in scope dimension values, so a `tenant`/`user`/`agent` value (from `resolveScope`) or an oddly-named workspace/route containing a delimiter can no longer corrupt the namespace or collide across scopes. Ordinary values (no reserved chars) are unchanged, so existing stored memories and persisted permission patterns keep matching byte-for-byte.

## 0.8.7

### Patch Changes

- 6a683c8: Smarter recall: long-term-memory `recall` now ranks results by IDF-weighted
  relevance blended with recency decay and stored confidence, instead of pure
  recency — a six-week-old fact that actually answers the query outranks
  yesterday's marginal match. Deterministic (no clock, no network, no new deps;
  same store + same query → same order), zero-config (tune via
  `DawnConfig.memory.recall` only if needed), and query-less searches (the
  injected index, `dawn memory list`) keep their recency order.

## 0.8.3

### Patch Changes

- 2744a5c: Add long-term memory. Routes gain a typed, cross-session memory collection via
  `defineMemory({ kind, scope, schema })` in `memory.ts` — the agent gets generated
  `remember`/`recall` tools backed by a namespaced `@dawn-ai/memory` store
  (node:sqlite, deterministic keyword+recency recall). Plus route-local `memory.md`
  profile injection and a `dawn memory` CLI (list/search/inspect/approve/reject/forget).
  Writes default to a `candidate` queue (config `memory.writes`). Ships the `semantic`
  kind; vector recall, episodic/procedural kinds, and the dev inspector UI are deferred.
  The research scaffold template now ships a `memory.ts`/`memory.md` example.
