# Chat — canonical Dawn harness example

> **Status:** foundational harness primitives (filesystem + bash) + the **planning capability**.
> Subagents, sandbox isolation, auto-summarization, and skills are still deferred — see
> "Deferred" below.

## What this shows

- Dawn route discovery and the `tools/` convention
- Filesystem tools (read/write/list) + bash, path-jailed to `./workspace`
- `AGENTS.md` memory autoload — Dawn auto-injects `workspace/AGENTS.md` into the system prompt on every turn; the agent updates it via `writeFile`
- **Planning** — `plan.md` in the route directory opts the agent into the built-in
  `write_todos` tool, a `todos` state channel, and a `plan_update` SSE event. Open the
  smoke client's event log; you'll see `event: plan_update` lines whenever the agent
  updates its plan.
- End-to-end streaming from a Next.js client over SSE

## Model choice

This example uses `gpt-5` with `reasoning: { effort: "high" }`. In live testing, smaller models (`gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`) tend to ignore explicit tool-use directives and produce generic "what can I help you with?" responses on the first turn — they don't reliably exercise the planning + memory capabilities. `gpt-5` engages with tools and actually drives an agent loop. The tradeoff: each turn costs more.

If you swap to a smaller model, expect to do more prompt-engineering work to get tool calls to fire.

## Quickstart

```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env   # add OPENAI_API_KEY
cp web/.env.example web/.env.local
pnpm install
pnpm dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

## Security caveats

**`runBash` executes shell commands on your machine with `cwd: workspace/` and a timeout.
This is NOT a sandbox.** Network calls, package installs, file ops outside `workspace/` via
shell expansion — all possible. Do not point untrusted users at this example.

## Deferred (Dawn phase-3 preview)

These v1 deferrals are the explicit forcing function for Dawn's opinionated harness work:

- Subagent delegation (`task`-style tool) — needs first-class subagent declarations
- Skills (`skills/` dir + `SKILL.md` loader) — mirror of the `tools/` convention
- Real sandbox isolation for `runBash` — needs pluggable execution backends
- Tool-output offloading and context summarization — needs lifecycle hooks
- Nested-object tool inputs (e.g., `edit_file({ edits: [{ old, new }] })`) — typegen extension
- Polished web UI — wait for harness primitives to stabilize
