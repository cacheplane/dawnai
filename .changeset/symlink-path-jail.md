Harden the workspace path jail against symlink escapes. `FilesystemBackend` gains a required `realPath(path, ctx)` method; `localFilesystem` implements it (resolving symlinks via the deepest existing ancestor so not-yet-created write targets work), and `createWorkspaceFs` canonicalizes both the candidate path and the workspace root before the permission gate. A symlink inside `workspace/` that points outside is now correctly gated instead of being silently classified as inside.

**Breaking for custom `FilesystemBackend` implementations:** add a `realPath` method — return the path unchanged (`async (p) => p`) if your backend has no symlink semantics.

**Behavior note:** allow rules for paths outside the workspace are now matched against the canonical (symlink-resolved) path. If your workspace or an allowed target lives under a symlink, express allow-rule paths in canonical form; rules written against a non-canonical alias will fail closed. (No effect when your paths contain no symlinks.)
