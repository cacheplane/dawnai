Add a binary read path to the workspace filesystem backend. `FilesystemBackend` gains an optional `readBinaryFile(path, ctx, opts?): Promise<Uint8Array>`, implemented by `localFilesystem` (same size-cap semantics as `readFile`), so binary I/O (e.g. reading an image) stays inside the sandboxed backend instead of dropping to `node:fs`. `withFilesystemLogging` now forwards `readBinaryFile` (logging the path only, never the bytes) and also preserves the optional `statFile`/`removeFile`/`touchFile`/`mkdir` methods it previously dropped when wrapping a backend.
