Argument-level tool constraints: `agent({ tools: { constrain: { deployProd: (args, ctx) => … } } })` runs a per-tool predicate against the model's arguments at call time, returning allow / deny-with-reason / `{ approve: true }` (escalate to the HITL prompt). Predicates may be async and receive a read-only policy context; a throwing or off-contract predicate fails closed. The tool run context now also carries the live `threadId` + route params. `dawn check` validates `constrain` tool names and warns on `approve`/`constrain` overlap.
