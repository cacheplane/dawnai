Add the `agents-md` built-in capability: Dawn now auto-injects `<workspace>/AGENTS.md` into every agent's system prompt under a `# Memory` heading on every model turn. Always-on (no opt-in marker). Preserves the feedback loop — the agent updates its memory via `writeFile` and the next turn sees the change automatically. Re-reads the file each turn (64 KiB cap; oversize, empty, or unreadable files render empty or a one-line notice).
