Unknown model ids now get advisory warnings instead of late provider 404s. `dawn check`/`verify` warn (exit code unchanged) when an agent route's `model` isn't in the curated list for its resolved provider (`openai`, `google`, `anthropic`, `xai`), with did-you-mean suggestions; the runtime prints the same `[dawn:models]` advisory once per model at chat-model construction. Curated lists are values now (`CURATED_MODEL_IDS` etc.) with types derived, Anthropic and xAI ids included; `validateModelId` and `inferProvider` are exported from `@dawn-ai/sdk`. Note: the narrow `GoogleModelId` union dropped the vendor-retired `gemini-3-pro-preview` (replaced by `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`); code typed against the narrow provider unions may need the new id, while `agent({ model })` callers are unaffected.
