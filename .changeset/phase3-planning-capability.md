Add the first phase-3 harness capability: planning. A `plan.md` file in a route directory now opts the agent into a built-in `write_todos` tool, a `todos` state channel, a Dawn-locked planning prompt fragment, and a `plan_update` SSE event. Introduces `CapabilityMarker` and `applyCapabilities` in `@dawn-ai/core` — the autowiring spine that all later phase-3 capabilities (skills, subagents, etc.) will reuse.
